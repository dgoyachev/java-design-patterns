Abstract Factory “provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects
without specifying their concrete classes”. In other words, this model allows us to create objects
that follow a general pattern.

An example of the Abstract Factory design pattern in the JDK is the newInstance()
of javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory class.
