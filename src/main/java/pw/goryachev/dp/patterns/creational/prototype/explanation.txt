The Prototype pattern is generally used when we have an instance of the class (prototype)
and we'd like to create new objects by just copying the prototype.

When we're trying to clone, we should decide between making a shallow or a deep copy.
Eventually, it boils down to the requirements.
For example, if the class contains only primitive and immutable fields, we may use a shallow copy.
